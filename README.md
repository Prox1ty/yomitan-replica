# About Yomitan-Replica
Web extension used to look up word definitions 

Inspired from a text-lookup extension called yomitan which I use for learning japanese. Selecting a word and pressing CTRL will activate an extension and a popup will be shown if a match is found
The word selected must be in it's dictionary form
